A work-in-progress solver for World (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

Usage: `python3 solver.py [--visual_mode=<boolean>] [--debug=<boolean>]`

Options:
    --visual_mode
        --visual_mode=True will run the solver with a GUI that allows entry of the guess. Clicking a square will toggle
        the color of that square. Press "Enter" to lock-in the guess. Visual mode requires tkinter to be installed.
        Visual mode is currently a work-in-progress.

        --visual_mode=False will run the solver using only text. Guesses must be entered as an eleven
        character lower case string of the form "<guess> <result>". The first five characters are for the word guessed
        and the last five characters are for the string of characters representing the correctness of the corresponding
        letter in the guess. Use _ for incorrect letters (black squares), ? for correct letter but incorrect position
        (yellow squares), and + for correct letter and position (green squares). For example, if the guess is "stick"
        and the colors are "black yellow black green green", enter the string as "stick _?_++".

        Defaults to False.

    --debug
        --debug=True will print debug output to the terminal while the solver executes.

        --debug=False will configure the solver to not print debug output.

        Defaults to False.
